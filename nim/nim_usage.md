# NVIDIA NIM / Nemotron usage (demo)

This demo uses **NVIDIA Nemotron via NIM** for:
- generating short human-readable **decision explanations** (why an action was blocked/approved)
- generating an **audit summary** across receipts

Policy enforcement itself is deterministic (policy-as-code). The model is used for explanation and summarization only.
